===========================================
Welcome to DroneKit-Python's documentation!
===========================================

DroneKit-Python helps you create powerful apps for UAVs. These apps run on a UAV's :ref:`Companion Computer <supported-companion-computers>`, and augment the autopilot by performing tasks that are both computationally intensive and require a low-latency link (e.g. computer vision). 

This documentation provides everything you need to :doc:`get started <guide/getting_started>` with DroneKit-Python, including an :doc:`overview <about/overview>` of the API, guide material, a number of demos and examples, and :doc:`API Reference <automodule>`. 

.. tip::

    If you're migrating from DroneKit-Python version 1, check out our comprehensive :ref:`Migration Guide <migrating_dkpy2_0>`.
