Example: Vehicle State
======================

This example shows how to get/set vehicle attribute and parameter information, 
how to observe vehicle attribute changes, and how to get the home position.

The guide topic :ref:`vehicle-information` provides a more detailed explanation 
of how the API should be used.


Running the example
===================

The example can be run as described in :doc:`running_examples` (which in turn assumes that 
the vehicle and DroneKit have been set up as described in :ref:`get-started`).

If you're using a simulated vehicle remember to :ref:`disable arming checks <disable-arming-checks>` so 
that the example can run. You can also 
`add a virtual rangefinder <http://dev.ardupilot.com/wiki/using-sitl-for-ardupilot-testing/#adding_a_virtual_rangefinder>`_
(otherwise the :py:attr:`Vehicle.rangefinder <dronekit.lib.Vehicle.rangefinder>` attribute may return 
values of ``None`` for the distance and voltage). 

In summary, after cloning the repository:

#. Navigate to the example folder as shown:

   .. code-block:: bash

       cd dronekit-python/examples/vehicle_state/


#. Start the example, passing the :ref:`connection string <get_started_connect_string>` you wish to use in the ``--connect`` parameter:

   .. code-block:: bash

       python vehicle_state.py --connect 127.0.0.1:14550

   .. note::
   
       The ``--connect`` parameter above connects to SITL on udp port 127.0.0.1:14550.
       This is the default value for the parameter, and may be omitted. 
          


On the command prompt you should see (something like):

.. code:: bash

    >>> APM:Copter V3.3 (d6053245)
    >>> Frame: QUAD
